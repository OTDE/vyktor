# What is Vyktor?

Vyktor is a mobile app for iOS and Android that's built with Flutter.

# What does it do?

Vyktor queries smash.gg's backend and finds tournaments near your phone's location, then displays them like this:

# Can I fine-tune the search?

Yep! You can adjust the search radius like so:

Or, if you'd like, change the times for the upcoming tournaments:

Notice Explore Mode there? If you're feeling real saucy, you can decouple your search from
your location and just look around the world by pressing and holding in a spot on the map.
